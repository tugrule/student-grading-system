# Student Grading System
Student grading system is a c++ project that allows users to save student records and grades. All user interaction takes places on the command line via the menu. All student records are saved to and parsed from a csv file. The csv file first lists the student record and then the course/criteria and grades. This system is intended for administrator use only but can be extended to allow for student use in the future.
